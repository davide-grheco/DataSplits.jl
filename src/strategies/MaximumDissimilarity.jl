    MaximumDissimilaritySplit(frac; distance_cutoff=0.35, metric=Euclidean())

Alias for `OptiSimSplit` with `max_subsample_size = N`, where `N` is the number of
samples.

Implements the **full OptiSim strategy** as described by Clark (1997), considering all
remaining candidates at each iteration and selecting the one that maximizes the
minimum dissimilarity to the selected set.

Best suited when high-quality representative subsets are essential and computational
resources allow.

Note:

- This method greedily includes outliers, if that is not desired outliers removal should be performed prior to splitting.
- This does not discard initially selected samples to account for the initial random selection.
